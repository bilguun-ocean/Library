Some things i've learned while doing this Project:
1. When in need to center a element(flexbox or anything) that has certain width using `margin: 0 auto;` works great. No use of margin or padding that is responsive or anything.

2. Making a model is to hide the form (`display: none`) and "unhide" it when a button is clicked (`display: absolute / fixed` etc). 

3. Required fields doesn't work when using inside a modal that has display:none



TO-Do
<!-- 1. When adding new book, keep the track of the book in an array. -->
<!-- 00. Implement remove button  -->
<!-- 00. Won't allow empty form / until all required fields are filled  -->
<!-- 2. When any of the book is removed, remove that book from the array and display the books in array. -->
<!-- 3. When close button or outside click is clicked, refresh the form inputs.  -->
4. Make sure the form is consistent across browsers


0. After done with functionality, refactor HTML, CSS, JS to make it neater.
